# R3
Recursive* Regex Renamer.

Rename files in current and sub-directories with full ECMAscript regex. Useful for mass stripping of data or making file names conform to a certain standard.

*The process was switched to an iterative approach early on in order to prevent stack overflow as well as allow easy switching between BFS and DFS.
